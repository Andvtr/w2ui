<h3>Custom Types</h3>
In versions pervious to v2, there was a way to add custom types. However, since with v2 the architecture is moved to classes, you can use class inheritance
to extend functionality to the input controls.
<textarea class="javascript">
class MyControl extends w2field {
    constructor(type, options) {
        super(type, options)
        ...
    }

    init() {
        ...
    }

    render(el) {
        ...
    }
}
</textarea>
